The accessibility of interactive technologies is often evaluated using checklists that are low-level, numerous, and platform-specific. Such checklists are typically used by accessibility experts, leaving everyday designers and developers with little support for assessing their own interfaces. To make accessibility evaluations easier to conduct, we devised a set of nine “ability heuristics” that prompt designers to engage with accessibility throughout the design process. We empirically evaluated these ability heuristics with 37 design students, comparing them to usability heuristics and WCAG. The ability heuristics emphasized the <i>quality</i> of accessibility features compared to the other methods, and surfaced issues that were more broadly dispersed across disability groups. Further, the students found the heuristics were as easy to use as the alternative methods. We argue that the heuristics help to move beyond binary notions of accessibility, pushing designers to consider the quality of features across diverse disabilities and the range of abilities within.
